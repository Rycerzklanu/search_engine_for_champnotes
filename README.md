Welcome to the LoL champion search engine manual.

This program is designed to help maintain a note repository for each champion in the game.
Right now it's completely unusable but this should change soon.

Installation:

1. Copy the repository's contents
Currently supported: Linux.
Support will be added for Windows as soon as possible.

This should be enough to make the program run.

Usage:

1. Open your terminal (Linux) or cmd (Windows)
2. Navigate to the folder the binaries are in by either cd (Linux) or dir (Windows)
3. Run the proper binary: ./linux_binary (Linux) or windows_binary.exe (Windows)
4. If this fails, make sure you are in the proper directory/folder as stated by your terminal/cmd
5. If everything works fine you will be greeted with a welcome screen. You can type "help" in the command line to see a list of all commands.


----------------------- 

NOTE: All commands in the "help" command and in the manual will be typed inside quotes. Inside the program, however, the proper usage is to type them without quotes, for example: 

Correct: help 

Incorrect: "help" 

Commands might be case sensitive so be careful about how you input them!
The default way to type is full lowercase so leave capslock alone and you'll be fine.

-----------------------


Description of all commands:

"help" - displays the names of all commands

"search" - prompts you to input a champion name (lowercase) and something happens then

"quit" - exits the program


More will be added here as the program develops.
